Explanatory Notes

1. Hash Router is because of GH Pages way of rendering

2. Navigation in general, one can say it is too nested. Yeah, it might be simplier but wanted to make full use of Layout/Outlet features.

3. Styling: While generally do not like MUI here took opportunity to use exclusively MUI (and what base React out-of-box styles are), just to gain some experience. Besides, styling is rather minimalistic by definition (or my idea of design);
